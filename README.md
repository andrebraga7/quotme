# **Quotme**

Quotme is a website developed to give users the ability to share and discover new quotes. The user can create an account, share new quotes, save and like other users quotes. The user can also follow a user to see relevant content from followers. Each user has a profile page that gives the user the possibility of writing a personal statement, add a profile image, edit the profile, change the username and password. Each quote allows the user to comment and share thoughts or show support for that quote. Each comment gives the user an option to reply to that specific comment, this allows the users to carry a conversation. The website also show to top ten most popular authors, the ones that have the most amount of quotes. When an user clicks on an author he is taken to the author page where he can view and search all quotes from that author.
The website was developed with a minimalistic and clean design goal, only showing essencial elements to give a fantastic overall user experience.
This project was developed as a Portfolio Project 5 - Advanced Front End Specialization as part of the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development from [Code Institute](https://www.codeinstitute.net).
